## Welcome! It's me!

My name is Reverson Claudio Dias, I was born in Brazil in 1989.  
I left my hometown when I was 18 years old to start college, I'm a bachelor in Computation Science I ends my college in 2011 at Universidade São Francisco. I lived in Itatiba until I finished college after that I moved to Campinas where I lived for 4 years. And I moved to São Paulo where I currently lived, I'm here for 5 years and here I started my DevOps journey. =)  
Currently, I'm working at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) as Sr. Infrastructure Consultant, where I performing a role to implement the best practices from DevOps culture, showing to the customers what they can use to get the best performance and results about their services or products or help them to improve their current environment.  

### A Professional Shot 

I work for more than 5 years in a cloud computing environment and ever involved with new challenges about new methodologies and tools. I've been focused on implementing DevOps culture through the companies where I worked. I'm passionate about Linux (Open Source projects), Kubernetes, and Cloud Computing!  
And I love making automation like improve CI/CD pipelines and some kind of integrations.  

### The Last Project I Worked

- I write terraform modules to deliver AWS infrastructure as a code. That codes are using in a CI/CD pipeline to deliver the infrastructure on-demand for the developers.  

- I deployed a project based on infrastructure as a code. Through a continuous delivery tool and integrated with a Github repository, I deployed an influx DB and influx DB relay on the AWS platform. For delivered it I used tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Shell Scripts. And Every modification that must be necessary had to be through by the Github repository.  

- I rebuilt the metrics platform with Prometheus and Thanos. I made a cross integrate two AWS regions, in the other words, there are two metrics environments on two AWS regions, but they can access each other. That metrics platform is integrated with AWS and Kubernetes cluster, each one on your region.  

- I helped the QA team to create automation to help them with some tests. Based on manual tests I used the AWS platform with some resources like Event Bridge, Lambda Functions end EC2 to create a flow 100% automatized with feedback through a message channel. Everything that we did following the infrastructure as a code conception.
