## Welcome! It's me!

My name is Reverson Claudio Dias, I was born in Brazil in 1989.  
I have left my hometown when I was 18 years old to start college, I'm bachelor's in Computation Science, and I finished college in 2011 at Universidade São Francisco. I have lived in the countryside until to finish college and to get more professional experience. Then I moved to São Paulo, the biggest city in Brazil, where I started my DevOps journey =) there I had lived for 6 years.  
Currently, I'm living in Porto - Portugal, and I work at Farfetch as Sr. Infrastructure Eng. Here I'm performing a role to implement the best practices to use Kubernetes using the GitOps as a model to deliver the applications and the resources to support it.

### A Professional Shot 

I working for more than 5 years with cloud computing environment and ever I was involved with new challenges about newer methodologies and tools. I've been focused on implementing DevOps culture through the companies where I have worked. I'm passionate for Linux (Open Source projects), Kubernetes and Cloud Computing!  
And I love making automation like improve CI/CD pipelines and some kind of integrations.

### The Last Project I Worked

- I wrote terraform modules to deliver AWS infrastructure as a code. Those codes were used in a CI/CD (Jenkins) pipeline to deliver the infrastructure on-demand for the developers.

- I have deployed a project based on infrastructure as a code. Through the continuous integration tool (CircleCI) integrated with a Github repository, it delivers an influxDB and influxDB relay on AWS platform. For delivered it I have used tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Shell Scripts. Every modification that must be done it must be done through the GitHub repository.

- I refurbished one metrics platform with Prometheus and Thanos. I made a cross integrate between two AWS regions, in the other words, there are two metrics environments on two different AWS regions, the environments are isolated but the metrics are crossed and can be accessed from any region. Those metrics platforms are integrated with AWS and Kubernetes clusters.

- I helped a QA team to create an automation to help them with some tests. Based on manual tests I have used the AWS platform with some resources like Event Bridge, Lambda Functions end EC2 to create a flow 100% automatized with feedback through a message channel(slack).

Everything that we did following the infrastructure as a code conception.
